# Multi-part prompts are ok; use | to separate each piece
# Use :# to indicate relative weights at the end of each prompt if desired, where # is a number (negatives ok)
# Use ! followed by a supported setting name to change the value of it for all prompts that follow it (see readme and examples)

# some basic examples:
a monkey on a motorcycle
a swimming pool full of trash

# change settings, all prompts below this will now use these new values
# make sure your specified input_image and transformer exist (see readme)
